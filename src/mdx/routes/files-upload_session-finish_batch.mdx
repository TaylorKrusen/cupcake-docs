namespace: files

menu: files
description: This route helps you commit many files at once into a user's Dropbox. Use `upload_session/start` and `upload_session/append:2` to upload file contents. We recommend uploading many files in parallel to increase throughput. Once the file contents have been uploaded, rather than calling `upload_session/finish`, use this route to finish all your upload sessions in a single request.\n`UploadSessionStartArg.close` or `UploadSessionAppendArg.close` needs to be true for the last `upload_session/start` or `upload_session/append:2` call. The maximum size of a file one can upload to an upload session is 350 GB.\nThis route will return a job_id immediately and do the async commit job in background. Use `upload_session/finish_batch/check` to check the job status.\nFor the same account, this route should be executed serially. That means you should not start the next job before current job finishes. We allow up to 1000 entries in a single request.\nCalls to this endpoint will count as data transport calls for any Dropbox Business teams with a limit on the number of data transport calls allowed per month. For more information, see the :link:`Data transport limit page https://www.dropbox.com/developers/reference/data-transport-limit`.
