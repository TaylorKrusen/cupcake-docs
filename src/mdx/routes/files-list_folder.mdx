description: Starts returning the contents of a folder. If the result's `ListFolderResult.has_more` field is `true`, call `list_folder/continue` with the returned `ListFolderResult.cursor` to retrieve more entries.\nIf you're using `ListFolderArg.recursive` set to `true` to keep a local cache of the contents of a Dropbox account, iterate through each entry in order and process them as follows to keep your local state in sync:\nFor each `FileMetadata`, store the new entry at the given path in your local state. If the required parent folders don't exist yet, create them. If there's already something else at the given path, replace it and remove all its children.\nFor each `FolderMetadata`, store the new entry at the given path in your local state. If the required parent folders don't exist yet, create them. If there's already something else at the given path, replace it but leave the children as they are. Check the new entry's `FolderSharingInfo.read_only` and set all its children's read-only statuses to match.\nFor each `DeletedMetadata`, if your local state has something at the given path, remove it and all its children. If there's nothing at the given path, ignore this entry.\nNote:&nbsp`auth.RateLimitError` may be returned if multiple `list_folder` or `list_folder/continue` calls with same parameters are made simultaneously by same API app for same user. If your app implements retry logic, please hold off the retry until the previous request finishes.
