## paper
This namespace contains endpoints and data types for managing docs and folders in Dropbox Paper.

New Paper users will see docs they create in their filesystem as '.paper' files alongside their other Dropbox content. The /paper endpoints are being deprecated and you'll need to use /files and /sharing endpoints to interact with their Paper content. Read more in the :link:`Paper Migration Guide https://www.dropbox.com/lp/developers/reference/paper-migration-guide`.
